After this insult to Melville, we can get straight to the point: I am a Full Stack developer, I enjoy solving problems, especially if it involves writing code. On this website you can find my blog, notes taken during my activity and some examples of my past projects.

You may have come across me online on [GitHub](https://github.com/sgrc31) or [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@sgrc31).
